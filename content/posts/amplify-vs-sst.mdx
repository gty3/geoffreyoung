# What is Amplify?

There are a couple different Amplify tools:

### Amplify Libraries

These are libraries to help interact with AWS resources like Cognito. These libraries are commonly used and not restricted to Amplify apps.

### Amplify Hosting

A CI/CD pipeline (process to streamline builds usually with git). This is a service and is comparable to [Seed](https://seed.run/).

### Amplify CLI / Amplify Studio

The CLI configures and creates AWS resources. After you create a project with the CLI, you can check out the resources in the console with Amplify Studio.

# What is SST?

SST, like Amplify CLI, is used to create and deploy AWS resources except with code. This is IaC or infrastructure as code.

# When to use what?

The Amplify CLI helps abstract complexity which can make for fast development. A developer making a smaller app with a good idea of its structure ahead of time can benefit from Amplify.

But in most scenarios it makes more sense to use SST:

- It’s easier to make changes; it’s easy to change code.
- The development lifecycle is simpler. Everything can be version controlled with git.
- You can use an IDE to see resource properties and even implement TypeScript to ensure proper configurations.

# Example

Let’s create some AWS resources.

Here we’re creating an API with a Lambda function that accesses DynamoDB.

## SST:

```tsx
const demoTable = new Table(stack, 'dynamo2e1dc4eb', {
    fields: {
      id: "string",
    },
    primaryIndex: { partitionKey: "id" }
  })

  const demoApi = new Api(stack, "Api", {
    routes: {
      "GET /items": "functions/itemsLambda.main"
    }
  })

demoApi.attachPermissions([demoTable])
```
