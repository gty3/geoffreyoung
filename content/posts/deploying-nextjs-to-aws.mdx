Now letâ€™s let everyone know about our app - we need to go to production.

Letâ€™s save everything we have with git. We want just 1 repository for the whole app. We need to remove the .git folder in our frontend that was created by create-next-app.

![Untitled](deploying-nextjs-to-aws/Untitled.png)

```tsx
rm -rf .git
```

SST does not initialize a new git repository so weâ€™ll create one

![Untitled](deploying-nextjs-to-aws/Untitled%201.png)

```tsx
git init
```

Letâ€™s save to a remote repository. I wonâ€™t go into the minutiae. If you arenâ€™t familiar, check out the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github).

Letâ€™s see if everything builds

![Untitled](deploying-nextjs-to-aws/Untitled%201.png)

```tsx
npm run build
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Be aware, SST environmental variables are not available to our app at build time. When we configured Amplify, I wrapped the `amplify.configure()` in `try/catch`, as it will fail configuration at build time.

</aside>

We can see our next.js app got built, and the whole SST app was built. Letâ€™s deploy to dev. 

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ So far weâ€™ve been running SST functions locally, in parallel with our Next.js app, this means our resources like api gateway and database are still deployed, but our backend functions and frontend are run locally. Deploying to dev puts all our resources in the cloud. See [docs](https://docs.sst.dev/live-lambda-development)

</aside>

Before we deploy letâ€™s add to MyStack.ts

![Untitled](deploying-nextjs-to-aws/Untitled%203.png)

```tsx
stack.addOutputs({
    siteUrl: site.url
  })
```

This will print out our Next.js URL in the console.

```tsx
npm run deploy
```

Success

Now if we visit that siteUrl - it should look like our site did on localhost.

# Going prod

I found myself an unregistered .com domain and registered it with AWS Route 53.

If you want a custom domain, purchase one on Route 53, [hereâ€™s a guide](https://sst.dev/chapters/purchase-a-domain-with-route-53.html)

[Or if you already have a domain not on Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-transfer-to-route-53.html)

Or if you donâ€™t want a domain, skip this step.

Create a new file .env

![Untitled](deploying-nextjs-to-aws/Untitled%206.png)

```tsx
DOMAIN_NAME=dropintalk.com
DOMAIN_ALIAS=www.dropintalk.com
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Making a .env file isnâ€™t always necessary, in this case it helps repeatability when cloning the repository.

Now in MyStack.ts we add the `customDomain` property to `site`

```tsx
const site = new NextjsSite(stack, "NextSite", {
    path: "frontend",
    environment: {
      NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: api.url,
      NEXT_PUBLIC_APIGATEWAY_NAME: api.httpApiId,
      NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID: auth.userPoolId,
      NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID: auth.userPoolClientId,
      NEXT_PUBLIC_IDENTITY_POOL_ID: auth.cognitoIdentityPoolId ?? "",
      NEXT_PUBLIC_REGION: stack.region,
    },
    customDomain: stack.stage === "prod" ? {
      domainName: process.env.DOMAIN_NAME ?? "",
      domainAlias: process.env.DOMAIN_ALIAS
    } : undefined
  })
```

In this case I only want to assign a domain name if in production. If I deploy to dev, it will use the AWS cloudfront address.

Now to deploy to production

```tsx
npm run deploy -- --stage prod
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Notice Iâ€™m using npm and not npx, npx would ignore this stage request.
