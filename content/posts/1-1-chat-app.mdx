title: Building a 1:1 chat app

This guide is for building a modern full stack web application. We will be using SST (serverless stack) to deploy both frontend and backend from one folder.

Requirements:

- minimal understanding of TypeScript, React, and AWS
- an AWS account

[Check out this guide if you donâ€™t have an AWS account](https://sst.dev/chapters/create-an-aws-account.html)

I really like the idea of 1:1 paid communication, something like [Premium.chat](http://premium.chat). Letâ€™s start building.

Check the live website: [DropinTalk](https://dropintalk.com)

Check the code: [github.com/gty3/dropintalk](https://github.com/gty3/dropintalk)

# Part 1 - Getting started with Next.js and SST

Create a new project:

```json
npx create-sst@latest --minimal
```

Iâ€™m choosing typescript and calling my project Dropintalk.

The CLI says to start the app but it doesnâ€™t matter, we just need to open the project.

```tsx
cd dropInTalk
code .
```

So we have our serverless stack created, we need to create our frontend Next.js application inside of it.

```json
npx create-next-app@latest --ts
```

Weâ€™ll call it â€˜frontendâ€™, this will be referenced by our SST stack.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m using SST 1.6.1 and Next.js 12.2.3, not all features of Next.js 12 are compatible.

</aside>

Now we need to install `@sls-next/lambda-at-edge` to make our Next.js deployments work in SST. 

```json
npm install @sls-next/lambda-at-edge
```

Your workspace might look slightly different, Iâ€™ve remove the vitest package as well since we donâ€™t need it. Hereâ€™s how my package.json looks:

Letâ€™s connect our frontend to our serverless stack.

MyStack.ts should look like this:

```tsx
import { StackContext, NextjsSite, Api } from "@serverless-stack/resources";

export function MyStack({ stack }: StackContext) {

  const api = new Api(stack, "Api", {
    routes: {
      "GET /": "functions/lambda.handler",
    },
  })

  new NextjsSite(stack, "NextSite", {
    path: "frontend"
  })

  stack.addOutputs({
    ApiEndpoint: api.url
  })

}
```

Weâ€™re adding `new NextjsSite` and referencing the folder we created previously - frontend. 

 We import the`NextjsSite` construct from serverless-stack resources. [Docs](https://docs.sst.dev/constructs/NextjsSite) 

This allows us to deploy our NextjsSite using AWS resources.

Now letâ€™s run, npm i, then npm start

The serverless stack is up and running locally, letâ€™s get the frontend running, open another CLI, and cd to the frontend folder.

```json
cd frontend/; npm i; npm run dev
```

Letâ€™s open up our browser and head to localhost:3000. Our Next.js site is now hosted locally.

Now itâ€™s time to make a rudimentary landing page.
