    With the passage of time, the brake on my bicycle has started to stop working correctly, I did not want to visit this site again because I would not have to come across it again, but since it is something as important as the brake on my bike, I did not I had no choice but to go.  Last Monday I decided to visit this place one more time crossing my fingers because the guy who sold me my bike wasn't there.
    
    To my surprise I ran into a completely friendly guy, who explained to me very well what was happening with the brake on my bicycle, he gave me an estimate of what it would cost to change both brakes, he adjusted one of them without any extra cost, he paid attention to all the details and as if that were not enough, he sprayed both brakes with a special fluid to see if the condition of my brakes improved.  It was a deal of 10 and I realised that he is a great professional and the most important thing: that he knows how to deal with clients properly, thank you very much Jeff, for your help, your time and your professionalism.`,
