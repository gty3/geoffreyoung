    <div>{"Hi, Iâ€™m an American currently in Australia on a working holiday visa. I have been living in various places around the States and world working as a bicycle mechanic. For the past 5+ years I have devoted as much of my time as possible to becoming a proficient web developer. I have been building apps primarily with react, and for the past 3 years using the Next.js framework. I started out building backends with Node.js using noSQL databases and writing infrastructure as code. I became intimately familiar with AWS products and but have recently shied away from building backends and to use Next.js completely."}</div>
